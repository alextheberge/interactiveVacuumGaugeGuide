## Local Development

To run this site locally using Jekyll:

### Prerequisites

1.  **Ruby:** Ensure you have Ruby installed (version 2.5.0 or higher). You can check with `ruby -v`. If not installed, download it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
2.  **RubyGems:** RubyGems is a package manager for Ruby. It's usually installed with Ruby. Check with `gem -v`.
3.  **GCC and Make:** You might need GCC and Make if your system doesn't have them. Check with `gcc -v` and `make -v`.
    * On macOS, installing Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) should provide these.
    * On Windows, you can use the RubyInstaller Development Kit.
    * On Linux, use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install build-essential` for Debian/Ubuntu).
4.  **Bundler:** Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`

### Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (or create your project):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alextheberge/interactiveVacuumGaugeGuide.git](https://github.com/alextheberge/interactiveVacuumGaugeGuide.git)
    cd interactiveVacuumGaugeGuide
    ```
    If you're starting a new project, create a directory and `cd` into it.

2.  **Create a `Gemfile`** (if it doesn't exist from cloning) with the content shown above.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

4.  **Create/Place your HTML file:**
    * Ensure `index.html` (with the HTML structure) is in the root of your project.
    * Ensure `assets/js/script.js` (with the JavaScript logic) is in the `assets/js/` directory.

5.  **Create `_config.yml`** (if it doesn't exist from cloning) with the content shown above.

6.  **Run the Jekyll server:**
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
    ```
    This will start a local server, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/interactiveVacuumGaugeGuide/`. The `--livereload` flag will automatically refresh the page when you make changes.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1.  Ensure your repository is named `interactiveVacuumGaugeGuide` on GitHub and that you are pushing to the `main` or `master` branch (or whichever branch you've configured for GitHub Pages).
2.  In your repository settings on GitHub, under "Pages", select the source branch for GitHub Pages (e.g., `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder).
3.  GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your Jekyll site. The site will be available at `https://alextheberge.github.io/interactiveVacuumGaugeGuide/`.

Make sure your `_config.yml` has the correct `baseurl` and `url` settings for GitHub Pages to build links correctly. -->
